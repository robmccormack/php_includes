Steps:
1. Duplicate this page as index.php  (you  have to use .php, since we'll be using PHP includes)
2. Create a folder called "/includes"  to hold the includes
3. Create a file called /includes/header.php with the header of this page
4. repeat above, for footer.php
5.


At top of this index.php, use this
```
<?php
$title = "BigSite.com .: HOME :.";
$showad = true;
include 'includes/header.php';
?>
```


6-
at bottom of this page use this
<?php include 'includes/footer.php'; ?>
